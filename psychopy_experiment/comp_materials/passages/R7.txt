The furthest west Greek settlement of importance was Massalia, where Greeks from Asia Minor brought grapevines. This started the famous French wine industry. Many interesting legends surround its founding. Around 650 BC, a sailor from Samos named Kolaios got lost on his way to Egypt. He returned with lots of silver from lands beyond the Pillars of Heracles and the Phoenician colony at Cadiz. Kolaios had been to what we now call Spain. Inspired by him, sailors from Phocaea in Asia Minor went west and set up trading posts on the coast of Spain. On the way, they found a natural harbor among fertile plains near the Rhone estuary and approached the local king, Nanus of the Ligurians. He was having a feast where his daughter Gyptis would choose a husband. Luckily for the Greeks, she liked one of them, named Protis or Euxenes, and married him. This marriage symbolized the happy union of Greek and local cultures, like the wedding of a brave Greek sailor and a French princess.

Our best source for colonization myths is Pindar, a poet from Thebes hired by wealthy Greeks to write praise poems. These were performed at festive events, like when a victor returned home from an athletic or musical competition. Pindar's poems tell beautiful legends about the founding of Cyrene. One legend praises Telesicrates, who won the hoplite race at Olympia in 476 BC. In this race, runners wore a bronze helmet and shin guards, carried a round shield, and were equipped like hoplite soldiers. Pindar's song for Telesicrates tells how Apollo fell in love with Cyrene, a maiden from Thessaly. She was a tomboy who preferred hunting to weaving. Apollo first saw her wrestling with a lion. He persuaded her to get into his golden chariot and took her to Libya, where he made her the ruler of the land named after her, "rich in flocks and abounding in fruits... on the root of the third continent." Cyrene's athletes were thus given Apollo as a divine ancestor and a brave foremother known for her physical strength.

When King Arcesilas of Cyrene won the chariot race at the Pythian games a few years later, Pindar expanded the story of Cyrene's founding by Battus, which was also known to Herodotus. Pindar connected this story to the journey of the Argonauts. Battus's ancestor Euphemus was an Argonaut; Euphemus had visited North Africa before starting the family line at Thera that would eventually found Cyrene.
