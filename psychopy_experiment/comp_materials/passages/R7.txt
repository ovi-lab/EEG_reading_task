All adult male citizens in ancient Athens had the right to attend and vote directly on state policy in the Assembly, the city's executive body. For voting to take place, at least six thousand men had to be present. The Assembly met about forty times a year to vote on important issues such as how to treat allies, manage the empire, and declare war. It also elected magistrates and the ten generals, who held significant domestic power in the fifth century. Every member of the Assembly could speak if they had completed two years of military service, although in reality, elite men and professional politicians often dominated the discussions. It was considered inappropriate for young men to speak for long periods.

Citizens gathered in the marketplace and moved toward Pnyx Hill, west of the Acropolis, where the Assemblies were held. A battalion of state slaves, archers from Scythia, guided the crowd with ropes and maintained order during the meetings. They removed men who were drunk, fighting, or making unpopular speeches. Contemporary sources note the loud noise during these gatherings: speakers needed powerful voices, and groups of supporters and opponents would try to shout each other down. In Aristophanes' comedy "Knights," the parody of two politicians competing for support in an Assembly debate involves streams of obscenities, slogans, bribes, and threats, all yelled at the top of their voices.

The agenda for the Assembly was usually set by the Council, known as the boule, which means "place for deliberation." This system seems remarkably democratic compared to our modern representative system. The boule's importance is highlighted by the fact that when oligarchs seized power in 411 BC, they quickly ousted the democratically elected councilors and took over the bouleuterion, the Council's building, for their own use. The boule required five hundred citizens to serve, selected proportionately from each deme (district), and they were replaced every year by lottery (from the mid-fifth century onward). This process ensured a broad representation of the citizen body. Since no man could serve more than twice in his life, most citizens had a high chance of serving at some point, especially after pay was introduced in the later fifth century to encourage poorer citizens to participate.

Originally, only the top three property classes could serve on the Council, excluding the poorest class, the thetes, but this restriction was eventually lifted or not strictly enforced. The Council met almost every day to discuss matters related to the state's finances, the scrutiny of magistrates, and various aspects of daily life in Athens, including festivals, the navy, building projects, and care for the sick, disabled, and orphaned. Serving on the Council required gathering information, reviewing past actions, and planning for the future nearly all day, every day. The level of commitment and attention required by Council service was much higher compared to the demands on politicians and ordinary citizens today.
