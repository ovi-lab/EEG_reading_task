In Crete, a major center of Mycenaean culture outside the Greek mainland, understanding early Greek speakers is more complex. Long before the Mycenaeans built their palace complexes in Greece, a group we call the Minoans, named after the mythical King Minos of Crete, had a similar civilization on the island. Crete was very important in the Aegean Sea and influenced the Mycenaeans culturally and possibly politically. Historian Thucydides might have been right when he said Minos "was the first person to organize a navy. He controlled most of what we now call the Hellenic Sea. He ruled over the Cyclades, where he founded the first colonies." This suggests that the Minoans had a thalassocracy, or a political system based on controlling the sea (thalassa).
Minoan civilization peaked between 1700 and about 1450 BC. The ethnicity of the Minoans is debated. They spoke a different language that was almost certainly not Indo-European. They used a form of writing called Linear A, but it has not been deciphered or translated. Although the palace at Knossos, excavated by Sir Arthur Evans in the early 20th century, is the most famous, there are other important Minoan palaces on Crete, mostly around the eastern coast. These include Phaistos (the second largest) and Gournia, excavated by American archaeologists Harriet Boyd Hawes and Edith H. Hall between 1901 and 1904. The Minoans also lived on smaller islands near Crete, including Thera (now known as Santorini).
In the mid-fifteenth century BC, Minoan palaces were destroyed by fire. The exact timeline is debated. Evidence shows more than one catastrophic volcanic eruption on Thera, possibly causing tidal waves that hit Crete's coast. The fires might have been linked to the eruptions or could have been caused or worsened by invaders. Most of the palaces were rebuilt. But one thing is clear: After the fires, the script for palace records changed from Linear A to Linear B. Greek speakers, likely from Mycenaean palaces on the mainland, took over the administration of Minoan Crete. Thucydides suggests that the Mycenaean empire had a large navy in the late Bronze Age, during the time he believed Agamemnon, who sailed to Troy, ruled.
