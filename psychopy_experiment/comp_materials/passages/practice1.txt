In the year 2150, rising sea levels had forced humanity to build underwater cities. One of the most advanced of these cities was Oceana, located deep in the Pacific Ocean. Oceana was a marvel of engineering, with transparent walls that allowed residents to see the vibrant marine life outside. The city was powered by renewable energy from ocean currents and algae farms.
Jenna, a 13-year-old girl, lived in Oceana with her family. One day, while exploring the city's outskirts with her robot companion, Max, she discovered an ancient shipwreck. Inside the wreck, they found old maps and strange artifacts. Jenna and Max took the maps to Dr. Marlow, a historian in Oceana. Dr. Marlow explained that the maps showed the locations of other shipwrecks that might hold valuable resources and historical treasures.
Excited by their discovery, Jenna and Max joined a team of explorers to uncover these shipwrecks. Their adventure led them to find rare materials that helped improve Oceana's technology and revealed important history about the world before the seas rose.
