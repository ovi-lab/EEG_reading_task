In Sparta, there were three hereditary classes. The highest class was the Spartiates, who were the citizens. They called themselves the homoioi, meaning "equals," and there were no distinctions of status within this group. However, they were divided into tribes and lived together in the "city," which consisted of five villages. To be a Spartiate, one had to inherit the status, go through the tough training of the agoge, and keep their place by being part of a mess (a communal eating group) and acting properly in battle. If these requirements were not met, a Spartiate could lose his status, face public shame, and have all contracts with other Spartiates canceled.
The social system in Sparta was unique and likely a response to land distribution issues that led to tyrannies and democracies in other Greek cities. Instead of those forms of government, Sparta developed a sense of solidarity and peer-group similarity among the ruling class. This unity was strengthened by a complex power-sharing system. Sparta always had two kings, creating a dyarchy instead of a monarchy. This system was meant to prevent any one king from gaining too much power. These two kings came from two different dynasties, the Agids and the Eurypontids, both claiming descent from Heracles, the son of Zeus. When not at war, the kings acted as priests of Zeus. They swore oaths with the ephors, the five annually elected officials of the Spartan Assembly, to respect each other's authority. The main lesson in Sparta was "to rule and likewise to be ruled." The ephors appointed magistrates and checked their performance, while the Assembly decided on matters like going to war.
To outsiders like Herodotus and Xenophon, the most remarkable feature of Sparta was the power of older men. Sparta was a gerontocracy, meaning it was ruled by elders. Herodotus was surprised that young Spartans always made way for senior citizens on the street, and there might have been a rule that young Spartans had to give up their seats for elders. The council in Sparta was called the gerousia, which means "House of Elders." Only men over sixty could become one of the twenty-eight gerontes (plus the two kings) who were part of this council. The gerontes served as judges in serious criminal cases.
