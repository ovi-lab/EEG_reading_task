Fighting in battles over and over could make Spartans feel like what we now call post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In Xenophon's story about the Spartan general Clearchus, a Vietnam veteran named Larry Tritle thinks this is "the first known case of PTSD in western stories." Xenophon says Clearchus chose to go to war even though he could have spent his money on peaceful activities. Clearchus was an adventurer who liked to lead from the front and only looked happy when he was fighting; otherwise, he looked angry and stern. He had a harsh voice, couldn't make close friends, and was very strict. He liked to do things his way and couldn't follow anyone else's orders. Once, after a fight in camp because he was too harsh, he almost started a battle between fellow Greeks. The Persian leader Cyrus had to step in to calm Clearchus down. But other Spartans, like Leonidas, lived to old age without these problems. Thucydides writes about the brave Spartan Brasidas as a smart, committed leader who died leading his men in 422 BC. Later, Spartan Gylippus's clever plans and speeches helped win the Peloponnesian War by defeating the Athenians at Syracuse.

Sparta was good at hoplite warfare because they built strong team spirit, had a fair system, and were very organized. Free Spartan men were treated equally. Kings and commanders fought alongside regular soldiers, risking their lives too. All free Spartan men wore the same kind of clothes and followed strict rules about what they could have. Training, eating, living, and fighting together made them very close and strong as a group. Anyone who didn't fight well would have to answer to the whole group later.

They also stuck together because they took their religion very seriously. Spartans were very religious and superstitious, which helped them follow their old laws without question. This might be why Leonidas felt he had to go to Thermopylae, as his ancestor Heracles had died on a nearby mountain. When Spartan kings died, everyone had to attend the funeral in mourning clothes or they would be fined. All government work stopped for ten days. Spartans also took omens and predictions very seriously. They never started a battle without making sacrifices, and often turned back if the animal signs were bad. The only two non-Spartans who were made full citizens were a professional fortune-teller and his brother.
