The greatest festival in Athens was the Panathenaea, held at the end of the first month of the new year, which is like our July. Nine months before the festival, two high-born teenage girls were chosen to live on the Acropolis. Under the guidance of the priestess of Athena, they wove a new gown for the statue of Athena Polias. This gown was a beautiful textile showing the goddess in her most famous feats. Eleven younger girls helped with the weaving.

The highlight of the festival started on the evening of the twenty-eighth of the month with a torch race that lit up the summer sky. This introduced the ritual songs and dances of the priestesses of Athena, which lasted all night. In the early morning, choruses of men and boys joined in, leading to a grand procession and sacrifices.

The procession showcased different groups that made up Athenian society and their relationships. Participants included the victors in competitions, the generals, respected elders carrying olive branches, cavalry, and probably some young soldiers in training (ephebes). A large section was made up of Athenian women carrying baskets. The Athenians showed their inclusive, multi-ethnic community by including non-Athenians in the procession. These included metics (foreign residents) carrying trays of bread and cakes, with their wives and daughters following with portable stools, as well as representatives from allied states and colonies. The mass of Athenians came last, organized by deme (local district). The highlight of the procession was the new gown for the ancient statue, which was displayed on poles, like a sail on a mast, on a float that might have looked like a ship. After gathering at the city walls, the procession went through the agora to the Acropolis. A hundred cattle were sacrificed on the public altar of Athena Polias, and the roasted meat was shared evenly among representatives of every deme.

Every four years, the Panathenaea turned into a larger event, open to visitors from all over the Greek world. This grand version lasted for twelve days and included musical and gymnastic contests, as well as boat races on the coast. In the years between, there was a smaller version called the Lesser Panathenaea, which lasted perhaps only two days and was more focused on Athenians. This included some competitions like the heavily armed war dance known as the Pyrrhic, horse races, and unique male beauty contests that were only for Athenians.

The experience of the Panathenaea was significantly changed by the transformation of the Acropolis during the building program led by Pericles.
