Life was changing fast for the Greeks in the eighth century BC. They traveled farther and traded with distant people, discovering new places. At home, their small and scattered coastal and island settlements, which had been fighting each other since the fall of the Mycenaeans, started to come together into city-states. They began to hold regular meetings at shared religious centers, like the sanctuary of Zeus, their main god, at Olympia.
A big new idea appeared in some Greek city-states. The idea was that a free man was equal in status to his peers, even without inherited wealth or noble identity. These free Greek men could call on others of the same status to support them in defending their rights and privileges. By the late sixth century, this idea of the ideal citizen led to democracy after many struggles.
These changes—expanding abroad, centralizing at home, and conflicts between social and economic classes—were sometimes contradictory. Yet together, they created a sense of Greek identity based on shared aspects of life. Any Greek speaker felt connected to others, despite differences in location or wealth. This included the cherished idea of individual self-sufficiency, often through small farming. This went along with competitive values and pride in the independence of the free individual. These men understood that conflict between rich and poor, and between those with inherited privileges and those who earned respect through excellence, was inevitable.
This value system was linked to the idea of political independence for individuals and communities. However, they followed common practices agreed upon by all Greeks. In the fifth century, Herodotus's Athenians defined these as sharing a genealogy, language, ritual sacrifices, and nomoi—laws or customs, agreed-upon rules of conduct, taboos, and imperatives like protecting vulnerable people on embassies and ensuring burial rights for the dead.
The Greeks were very aware of the importance of maintaining their culture and traditions. They were proud of their history and their achievements. The outlook of the Greeks during this time is captured in their earliest literature: four long poems. These are the Iliad and the Odyssey, epic tales attributed to Homer, and Hesiod’s Works and Days and Theogony. The rebellious and independent spirit of the Greeks is a key theme in all these works. They celebrated their heroes and their gods, telling stories that have been passed down through generations. This early literature helps us understand the values and beliefs that were important to the Greeks during this time.
Greek literature, like their society, reflected a mix of individualism and community values. It showed how they valued both personal achievement and collective identity. These stories and poems were not just entertainment; they were a way for the Greeks to share their values and teach future generations about their history and ideals. By preserving these stories, the Greeks ensured that their culture would endure and continue to inspire people for centuries to come.
