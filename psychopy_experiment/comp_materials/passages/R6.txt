The Nemean Games in northern Peloponnese were the last to start, in the early sixth century, but Olympia was already a place for Zeus worship in the ninth or even tenth century. Tradition says the famous Olympic Games began in 776 BC. By 800 BC, leaders from Peloponnesian communities met at Olympia to consult Zeus's oracle and compete in sports. Impressive gifts, especially bronze tripods, show that Olympia and its games began to attract Greeks from far away. The same happened at Delphi, where the first competitions in honor of Apollo were musical, not athletic. When Greeks from different tribes achieved something together, they called it a "Hellenic" achievement.

In the seventh century BC, eastern Greeks and men from Aegina went to the main port in the Nile Delta, which they named Naucratis (Ship Power). They offered their services as mercenaries to the pharaoh, traded silver, oil, and wine for Egyptian grain, linen, and papyrus, and created an important site where Egyptian and Greek cultures mixed. Some Greeks built a shared shrine there, called the Hellenion, defining their Greek identity despite coming from nine different cities.

Panhellenic shrines served two main purposes. Through their oracles, they managed relationships between the emerging Greek states, which wanted to stay independent from each other, much like individual Greeks wanted to be self-sufficient. They also provided a place for wealthy aristocrats and new rulers to show off their riches through athletics and grand offerings to the gods. At home, powerful families might have been discouraged from showing off too much, but at the Panhellenic shrines, they could compete with others from different city-states, showing their joint membership in a Panhellenic elite class.

The games at Olympia, held every four years, weren't enough to satisfy their need for such opportunities. So, games were also started at Delphi in the early sixth century (the Pythian Games), and at Nemea and the Isthmus. These games were scheduled so there was a Panhellenic gathering every year.

In the twenty-third book of the Iliad, Achilles holds games to honor his friend Patroclus's funeral. These epic games would have felt very Panhellenic to ancient audiences because the competitors in the poem, like them, came from many Greek regions and islands. Games, Panhellenism, military funerals, and war were closely linked in the minds of ancient Greeks. The foundation myths of all four major festivals with games claimed they were connected to funerals, and athletic events in ancient Greece developed from military training exercises.
