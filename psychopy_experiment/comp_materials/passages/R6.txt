The first ancient Greek to use the term philosophos, meaning "wisdom-loving," was Heraclitus. He lived in the late sixth century in the city of Ephesus, which was slowly filling with silt. Heraclitus was very interested in change and famously said that no river stayed the same. He believed fire was at the center of everything and that everything was always changing. Like Thales, later Greeks thought Heraclitus had learned from "the barbarian philosophy," perhaps influenced by the Persian religion, Zoroastrianism, which held fire as sacred. But regardless of where his ideas came from, Heraclitus is considered the first philosopher in the modern sense because he not only proposed that fire was the main principle of the physical world, but he also thought about abstract forces beyond the physical world (the metaphysical), aspects of perception, and principles of human behavior.

Heraclitus faced challenges in finding the right language to express his new ideas, making his writings difficult to read. This gave philosophy its reputation for being hard to understand. His writings are sometimes very obscure. There's a story that the tragedian Euripides gave a copy of Heraclitus's book to Socrates. When Socrates was asked his opinion of the book, he said, "The part I understand is excellent, and so too is, I dare say, the part I do not understand; but it needs a Delian diver to get to the bottom of it." Despite being hard to understand, Heraclitus was the first person who seriously thought about what philosophy involved, starting a self-conscious process of questioning the nature of existence.

Heraclitus's broad interests came from his idea of constant change, which helped him explain the confusing tension between sameness and otherness in the universe and society. Opposites can become united at different times or under different circumstances: "The same things in us are living and dead, waking and sleeping, young and old. For these things having changed around are those, and those in turn having changed around are these." Also, constant change affects how we see things. For example, the sea contains water that is both pure and polluted. For fish, it is drinkable and promotes health, but for humans, it is undrinkable and causes harm. Heraclitus believed that all matter was constantly being turned into fire and back again. In a very important fragment, he compares this process to the ceaseless "exchange" of gold into goods and vice versa. He saw the universe as being in constant flux, which could be measured, but only like the equivalent of cosmic money.
