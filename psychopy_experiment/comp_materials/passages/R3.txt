The "frontier mentality" described in the Odyssey is connected to the Greek colonization efforts, showing how early Greek traders needed to gather money and influence before starting new settlements. Many Greeks from the eighth to sixth centuries BC were restless and eager to move. Brave individuals left their homes in mainland Greece and on the western coast of Asia to create new settlements far away. This led to the distinctive map of ancient Greece, with towns spread along many coasts and islands of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea.
Greek colonizing activity increased in the seventh and sixth centuries BC. This growth is linked to the determination of less wealthy Greeks, during times of scarce resources, to gain economic independence and political self-determination. The Greeks' drive for independence and their rebellious spirit were closely tied to their strong sense of individuality. During this time, the Greeks spread their way of life—including their gods, songs, vines, and drinking parties—to almost every corner of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea.
We meet many Greeks with distinct personalities and goals in this period. They saw themselves not just as members of a colony or class but as important individuals. Some were founders of colonies and "tyrants," new types of leaders. Others included poets, athletes, mercenaries, priestesses, entrepreneurs, vase painters, and explorers who wanted to be remembered. Some of their stories are connected because those seeking fame would hire famous poets like Pindar to enhance their reputation and even create a family tree linking them to legendary heroes like Heracles or another Argonaut. The age of colonization was also an age of Greek individualism.
The many individual Greek communities from this period can make studying it confusing. The confusion is worsened by the Greeks' habit of using old names for new settlements they founded, such as Heraclea, Megara, and Naxos. However, this proliferation is what made this period so important. The Greeks significantly increased the number of communities they lived in and the ethnic groups they interacted with, expanding their shared horizons in a fundamental and lasting way.
