The royal family lived in a really fancy way. In their palace, like the one in Nestor's Pylos from the Odyssey, there was always lots of wine. People who dug up Pylos found thousands of cups and bowls in rooms on the west side of the main building. The palace also had plenty of olive oil and even a room just for making perfume. There were many rooms upstairs, which you could get to by a staircase. On the ground floor, there were at least two sets of apartments. One had a big fancy bathtub made of terra-cotta, and another had a toilet and a drain.

When Telemachus left Pylos, he traveled in a horse-drawn chariot to Sparta, to the beautiful palace of Menelaus and his wife, Helen, who was forgiven after the Trojan War. Homer described the Spartan homeland of Lacedaimon as "hollow" but also "full of gorges," which fits the Eurotas valley under its tall mountains. Two Mycenaean mansions were built in the fifteenth and fourteenth centuries BC, near the site of the later Menelaion, or hero shrine, for Helen and Menelaus at Therapne on a ridge near Sparta. The first offerings at the shrine are from the eighth century, but by then the mansions were gone, destroyed by fire in the thirteenth or twelfth century. Their design was like the palace at Pylos but on a smaller scale. They might have been where the "real" Menelaus, like the one in Homer's stories, lived.

No Mycenaean palace is as well kept as the one at Pylos. But the huge walls at Tiryns, near the port town of Nafplio, still make a strong impression. The Homeric name for Tiryns was "walled," and for a good reason. When Pausanias, a traveler, visited Tiryns in the second century AD, he was amazed by the walls. The ancients called them "Cyclopean," thinking only giants could build them. Pausanias said, "Tiryns is made of rough stones, each so big that two mules couldn't move even the smallest one." The stones are huge: 6 feet long and 3 feet wide, making a wall 148 feet high. During the Persian Wars, some rebel slaves from Argos hid behind these walls for months before being caught. Maybe living in this heavily fortified place made Antaea, Queen of Tiryns, fall madly in love with Bellerophon, a handsome guest from nearby Corinth. When he turned her down, she falsely accused him of attacking her. Her husband, Proitos, was furious.
